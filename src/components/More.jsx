              Hello! I'm a passionate web developer based in Gala»õi, Romania,
              with a deep love for creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly
              websites. My journey into coding began out of a curiosity for how
              things work on the web, and it quickly grew into a full-fledged
              passion for building and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places, listening to
              hip-hop music, and playing strategy video games. I believe that
              creativity and a desire to learn are the keys to a successful
              project, and I bring that mindset to every project I undertake.

              I believe in continuous learning. Currently, I'm diving deep into

              React projects. I'm also exploring **Docker** to streamline my
              development workflow and better understand containerization.
